            <p class="text-justify mb-4">My name is Zarina Mazieva, I am originally from Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan. It is small country located in Central Asia and is a former Republic of Soviet Union. I was born there, finished school and university and moved to the United States back in 2004. I hold Master of Science degree in Economics from Bishkek Humanities University. My diploma thesis was about “Advantages and disadvantages of Free Economic Zones and their impact on National Economy”. Besides English I can also speak Russian.</p>

            <p class="text-justify mb-4">After moving to the United States, I mostly worked in banking industry and trading stocks as a hobby. My first position was with US Bank as an banker. My last position was with Bank of America as a Relationship Manager. During my career I learned how to help customers by understanding their financial situation and offering them the right solution and product.</p>

            <p class="text-justify mb-4">Now I am taking actions toward my new carrier and studying Web Development at University Of Washington. During this course I was able to implement a few projects using JavaScript, AJAX, jQuery, Node.js, Bootstrap, HTML, CSS etc. I have marked my first milestone by completing my first group project with two more coming soon. It was very exciting for me to be able to implement applications and see quite significant progress just in the first few weeks of the course.</p>

            <p class="text-justify mb-4">I'm aspiring to become a user-focused Web Developer with a passion for making technologies to solve real life problems and improve user experience. I enjoy writing algorithms and solving complicated technical problems with unique perspectives on how end-users interact with websites and software platforms. I'm focused on delivering working applications according to stakeholder's expectations and users' feedback.</p>
